## Getting started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run the script using the following command:

<pre>python number_guess.py</pre>


## Usage
The script prompts the user to input a range for the game, then randomly generates a number within that range.
The user then inputs their guess and the script will notify them if they have won or lost the game.

If the user's guess is equal to the generated number, the script will print "You rock!" in the command line.
If the user's guess is not equal to the generated number, the script will print "Unfortunately you lost".
